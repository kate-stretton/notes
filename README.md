# Notes - Fullstack boilerplate
Notes is a personal project I worked on while completing Dev Academy Aoteroa. The app can be used for note taking and is currently still in progress.

Users can currently read, add and delete notes from the database.

### From the command line

```
git clone https://github.com/dev-academy-challenges/boilerplate-fullstack [your-project-name]
cd [your-project-name]
npm install # to install dependencies
npm run dev # to start the dev server
```

You can find the server running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
